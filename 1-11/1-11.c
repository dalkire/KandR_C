/*
 * Exercise 1-11.
 * How would you test the word count program?
 * What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if
 * there are any?
 *
 * I would test it by taking advantage of its weak definition.
 * printable characters that connect words would combine two
 * words into one according to the definition that "a word
 * is any sequence of characters that does not contain a blank,
 * tab or newline."
 *
 * Thus "found him...dead", or "left homeâ€”having sailed", would
 * result in word counts of 2 and 3, respectively.
